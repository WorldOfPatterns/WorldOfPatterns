### Intent

Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype. 

### Applicability

Use the Prototype pattern when a system should be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented; and

- when the classes to instantiate are specified at run-time, for example, by dynamic loading; or
- to avoid building a class hierarchy of factories that parallels the class hierarchy of products; or
- when instances of a class can have one of only a few different combinations of state. It may be more convenient to install a corresponding number of prototypes and clone them rather than instantiating the class manually, each time with the appropriate state.

### Participants

- Prototype
  * declares an interface for cloning itself.  
- ConcretePrototype
  * implements an operation for cloning itself.  
- Client
  * creates a new object by asking a prototype to clone itself.
