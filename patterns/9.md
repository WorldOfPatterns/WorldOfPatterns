### Intent

Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes!! :D

### Applicability

Use the Abstract Factory pattern when

- a system should be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented. 
- a system should be configured with one of multiple families of products.  
- a family of related product objects is designed to be used together, and you need to enforce this constraint.  
- you want to provide a class library of products, and you want to reveal just their interfaces, not their implementations.  

### Structure

![structure](http://www.c-jump.com/CIS75/Week11/const_images/abstract_factory_structure.png)

### Participants

- AbstractFactory
  * declares an interface for operations that create abstract product objects. 
- ConcreteFactory
  * implements the operations to create concrete product objects. 
- AbstractProduct
  * declares an interface for a type of product object. 
- ConcreteProduct
  * defines a product object to be created by the corresponding concrete factory. 
  * implements the AbstractProduct interface. 
- Client
  * uses only interfaces declared by AbstractFactory and 
  * AbstractProduct classes.
