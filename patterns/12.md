### Intent

Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations. 

### Applicability

Use the Builder pattern when 

- the algorithm for creating a complex object should be independent of the 
parts that make up the object and how they're assembled. 
- the construction process must allow different representations for the 
object that's constructed.

### Participants

- Builder
  * specifies an abstract interface for creating parts of a Product object. 
- ConcreteBuilder
  * constructs and assembles parts of the product by implementing the Builder interface. 
  * defines and keeps track of the representation it creates. 
  * provides an interface for retrieving the product.
- Director
  * constructs an object using the Builder interface. 
- Product
  * represents the complex object under construction. ConcreteBuilder builds the product's internal representation and defines the process by which it's assembled. 
  * includes classes that define the constituent parts, including interfaces for assembling the parts into the final result.
